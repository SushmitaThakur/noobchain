# Noobchain
A blockchain proof of concept project based on the tutorial by [kass](https://medium.com/@cryptokass) to learn to create a simple blockchain system.

### Project Overview

This project walks through creating a simple blockchain and implementing a basic proof of work system in Java. It consists of the following components:

- **Blockchain**: Implements a chain of blocks, each containing data and a hash reference to the previous block.
- **Transactions**: Includes functionality for creating and managing transactions, storing inputs and outputs.
- **Proof of Work (Mining)**: Introduces a mining mechanism for block validation via computational work.

## Folder Structure
The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.
